      The Appalachian Mountains run for 1,500 miles along the east coast of the
      United States from northern Alabama to Maine. The highest point of the
      Appalachians is 6,684 feet at Mount Mitchell in North Carolina. The
      Appalachians are part of a temperate forest biome and are mostly covered
      with a variety of trees including pine trees, spruce, birch, and maple
      trees. Animals that can be found in the Appalachians include squirrels,
      cottontail rabbits, white-tailed deer, wolves, beavers, black bears, and
      the red-tailed hawk. The Appalachians played an important role in the
      early history of the United States. They served as a barrier to expansion
      for the first colonies. At one point, Britain made a deal with the Native
      American tribes that colonists would not settle beyond the Appalachian
      Mountains. However, people soon found passes through the mountains and
      blazed trails beyond the mountains such as Daniel Boone's Wilderness
      Trail.
